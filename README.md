# React Boilerplate

A basic boilerplate setup for **React 18** applications with modern best practices. This boilerplate is ideal for developers who want a minimal, customizable starting point for their projects without relying on frameworks.

## ‚ú® Features

- **React 18 with Concurrent Rendering**: Leverages React's `createRoot` API for optimal performance.
- **TypeScript Ready**: Provides static typing for scalable and maintainable development.
- **Babel and Webpack**: Configured for ES6+ and JSX transpilation with hot module reloading.
- **Modern Folder Structure**: Organized for clarity and ease of scaling.
- **Customizable**: Minimal dependencies to allow full control over the development environment.
- **Accessibility First**: Built with accessibility in mind to ensure inclusive user experiences.
